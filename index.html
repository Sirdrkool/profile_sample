            <p>I have over thres decades of experience, one-third of which was in marketing industrial chemicals. My expertise spans the economics of raw material and industrial chemical markets, focusing on supply chain dynamics, market demand analysis, pricing strategies, and effective commercialization techniques.</p>
            <p>Previously, I served as a Fellow of Edinburgh University's Scaling Business in Africa program, where my research centred on raw material research commercialization. Before this, I was Chief Executive Officer at Value Fronteira Limited, a renowned research firm. Additionally , I have served as the Executive Director of the GTI Trade Desk, in charge of the natural commodities (including chemicals and raw materials) trading desk. I also served as the Chief Operating Officer/General Manager of Grow Africa Limited, spearheading cross-country strategies for industrial chemicals and raw material market analysis. As a Fellow of the African Centre for Supply Chain, my interest involved raw material sourcing, acquisition, processing, and refining for market distrubution.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have cultivated multifaceted experience across industry across industry, consulting, academia, and policy-making spheres. As a member of the NANO tech research group of the University of Nigeria Nsukka and the STI-to-Business Initiative, my primary objective is to bolster economic diversification, catalyze industrial growth, ensure food security, and empower communities across Nigeria by leveraging the untapped potential of raw material resources.</p>
